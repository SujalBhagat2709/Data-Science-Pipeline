# 📊 Data Science Pipeline – End-to-End Workflow

This repository contains a complete, practical, and easy-to-understand **Data Science Pipeline** implemented using Python.  
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how **raw data is collected, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and converted into meaningful insights** through a structured workflow.

The entire pipeline is written in a **simple, clean, and human-readable style**, so that students, beginners, and professionals can easily understand each step.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In real-world data science projects, raw data is often messy, incomplete, and inconsistent. Before performing any meaningful analysis or building machine learning models, it is essential to **process and understand the data properly**.

This project implements the **complete data science lifecycle**, including:

1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning (Preprocessing)  
3. Data Transformation  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Data Analysis  
6. Visualization & Reporting  
7. Decision Making  

Each stage is implemented as a **separate Python script**, making the project modular, structured, and easy to follow.

## 🔹 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Data Collection  
**File:** `01_data_collection.py`

- Loads raw data from a CSV file  
- Displays basic dataset information  
- Saves a snapshot of the raw data  

**Goal:** Obtain and understand the raw data.

---

### 2. Data Cleaning (Preprocessing)  
**File:** `02_data_cleaning.py`

- Removes duplicate records  
- Handles missing numeric values using median  
- Handles missing categorical values  
- Saves cleaned data  

**Goal:** Ensure data quality and reliability.

---

### 3. Data Transformation  
**File:** `03_data_transformation.py`

- Scales numeric features  
- Converts data types where required  
- Saves transformed data  

**Goal:** Prepare data for analysis and modeling.

---

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**File:** `04_eda.py`

- Generates statistical summaries  
- Plots correlation heatmaps  
- Visualizes feature distributions  

**Goal:** Understand patterns, trends, and relationships in data.

---

### 5. Data Analysis  
**File:** `05_data_analysis.py`

- Computes mean, median, and variance  
- Analyzes relationships between variables  
- Identifies key insights  

**Goal:** Extract meaningful insights from the data.

---

### 6. Visualization & Reporting  
**File:** `06_visualization_reporting.py`

- Creates charts and graphs  
- Generates summary reports  
- Visualizes department-wise comparisons  

**Goal:** Communicate insights clearly and effectively.

---

### 7. Decision Making  
**File:** `07_decision_making.py`

- Interprets analysis results  
- Generates actionable insights  
- Prepares data for machine learning pipelines  

**Goal:** Support informed, data-driven decision making.
